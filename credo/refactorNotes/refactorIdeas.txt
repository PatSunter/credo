Improving JobRunner, ModelResult, ModelSuite etc
------------------------------------------------

- Note: from Sharples' examples, should probably force writing of model
  run and model result
   XMLs at run-time, otherwise the user will likely forget this step 
   (perhaps as a param to runModel that's set to True by default).

- Adding timing functionality to the JobRunner
^^^^^^^^^^^

- This will also involve stuff like improving the way suites are
  generated (e.g. with iterators)

- And also factor into this the command line input processing
 (perhaps a PETSc or Pyre like
   system for managing this, where objects can handle as appropriate).
