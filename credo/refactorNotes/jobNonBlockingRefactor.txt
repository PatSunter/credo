Aim:
----

for specifying basic tests or modelRuns in Python scripts,
user shouldn't have to add all the PBS or Grid info by default ...
they should then be able to pass in dictionaries for Grid or PBS
when running a Suite, and it will "upgrade" the default JobParams
to contain any architecture-specific stuff.

Steps/issues:
-------------

* Basic JobMetaInfo hierararchy

* D For the PBSJobRunner, should we ideally get it to run a suite
    submitted in parallel, rather than sequential? (Yes)
* D Properly handle MaxRunTime as a JobParam (eg same as nProc)
* D Ability to easily write this out to XML
  (Does it include sub-dicts of params to write to XML automagically?
* D Move PBS-specific stuff out of constructModelRunCommand to 
   e.g. PBSJobParams ....
* Deal with the "InputFilePath" stuff of Wendys ....

Qtns:
-----
 * Do JobMetaInfo and JobParams move to JobRunner subdir?
