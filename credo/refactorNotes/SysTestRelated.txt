Notes that came up while doing Sci benchmark improvement
-------------------------------

For SysTests (XML record writing):
 - define a dict/list of "specification" elements (and a dict/list
    of "results" aspects?)
  - then these can be queried, auto-magically saved to XML records,
     or presented in displays by stuff like ReportLab

Make test Suite stuff a "Register" factory process like StGermain, where
CREDO manages a global register of test cases that have been set up:
 - e.g. testSuite.credo.SysTestSuite("Underworld", "SciBench-ThermalConv")
 - and then you could add appropriate tests easily, and if your master
    script involves importing multiple benchmark scripts,
    they will all be in same suite
 - Hmmm - neat but maybe too "magical" so user has to learn behind scenes?   

Test result and analytic test generation:
-----------------------------------------

Refactoring test and analytic components to be simpler
^^^^^^^^^^

Refactor CREDO so Analysis Ops and Test components are in the same directory ...
 thus you can easily define a new Analysis Op, and then a test component
 based upon it.

And perhaps allow much simpler generation of Analysis Op classes
and TestComponents:

N.B. really the bare minimum for a new CREDO test component is:

(Optional) set up analysis ops
 (e.g. may be just an XML snippet).

A bit of code to do a check and:
 - return a result status
 - a result message to print to XML
 - and an XML snippet (currently in ETree format) to add.
