Ideas for regular analytic/performance tests:

Create a standard report template for key elements of each system test,
e.g. Analytic, reference

Description:
 - E.g. Analytic tests can parse the Analytic solution directory specified
   by the plugin, and if possible grab/report some info
   (e.g. at least the name of the Analytic soln plugin, and provide a link
    to it in the Codex, and ideally could slab in some RST/Latex talking about
    the equations used, as an appendix.)

Analysis Images:
 - E.g. Analytic tests can parse the expected directory for an image of the
    expected solution, and display it alongside a pic of the actual soln
