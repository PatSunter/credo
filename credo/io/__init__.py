The IO Module in CREDO is for Input/Output to various forms of data important for
analysis and testing of StGermain codes.

These are primarily related to the core data formats that StG-based codes such
as Underworld:

* Accept data in to configure and run models, such as the StGermainData XML
  format.
* Produce data in as a result of running models, such as the FrequentOutput.txt
  files specifying observables produced on a regular basis during running of a
  timestepped model.
