'''A Module for dealing with StGermain "Convergence" files, i.e. records of 
comparison between a set of Fields and either reference or Analytic solutions,
produced by the FieldTester Component.

The module is not fully object-oriented, and in the current design allows for
the possibility of a set of cvg files in one path that should all be referenced.
(e.g. the see function :func:`genConvergenceFileIndex`).

It provides a similar, though not identical, interface to the 
:mod:`credo.io.stgfreq` module.

The format of CVG files is space-separated, of the form:

* Header lines, which may be repeated throughout the file::

    #Res        FieldName1      FieldName2 ...

* Values lines, which are of the form::

    <len scale> <field value 1> <field value 2>

For example::

  #Res TemperatureField1 TemperatureField2
  1.000000e-01 6.16e-03 5.5e-2
  #Res TemperatureField1 TemperatureField2
  1.000000e-01 6.14e-03 5.4e-2
  #Res TemperatureField1 TemperatureField2
  1.000000e-01 6.12235812e-03 5.3e-2
