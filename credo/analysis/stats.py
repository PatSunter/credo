The aim is for simple functions to be able to run without further dependencies
... with more advanced stats libraries from the likes of SciPy being able to be
loaded at the user's discretion."""

    Summary
        Linear regression of y = ax + b

    Usage
        real, real, real = linreg(list, list)

    Returns coefficients to the regression line "y=ax+b" from x[] and y[], and R^2 Value

    (Obtained from From

    Useful for field analysis, e.g. when applied to a list of length scales
    & field errors, to calculate convergence info, such as
