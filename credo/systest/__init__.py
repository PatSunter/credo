"""
This module contains the System Testing functionality of CREDO. 

Working at a higher-level than the :mod:`credo.modelrun` and
:mod:`credo.analysis` modules, it is able to use their
capabilities to run system tests of scientific applications,
and communicate and record the results.

From a user perspective, doing an::

  from credo.systest import *

Should allow key functionality to be accessed: e.g. the 
:class:`credo.systest.systestrunner.SysTestRunner` class, and standard system
tests such as Analytic, Restart and Reference.

Examples of how to use this module are provided in the CREDO documentation,
see :ref:`credo-examples-systesting`.

.. note:: in early CREDO versions, importing credo.systest would have imported
   into it the entire namespace of the credo.systest.api module. But Python 2.5
   disallows this for relative imports (although the feature was added
   back in in Python 2.6) ... so the import of the credo.systest.api namespace
   into credo.systest was removed, and we only import the 'public interface'
   of implementations designed to be used from the API in testing.

   As a result, if you want to define new :class:`.api.SysTest` or 
   :class:`.api.TestComponent` implementations, you should `import 
   credo.systest.api` to access the base classes of these.
