class RestartTest(SingleModelSysTest):
    '''A Restart System test.
       This case simply runs a given model for set number of steps,
       then restarts half-way through, and checks the same result is
       obtained. (Thus it's largely a regression test to ensure 
       checkpoint-restarting works for various types of models).
       Uses a :class:`~credo.systest.fieldWithinTolTC.FieldWithinTolTC`
       test component to perform the check.

       Optional constructor keywords:

       * fullRunSteps: number of steps to do the initial "full" run for.
         Must be a multiple of 2, so it can be restarted half-way through.
       * fieldsToTest: Which fields in the model should be compared with the
         reference solution.
       * defFieldTol: The default tolerance to be applied when comparing fields of
         interest between the restarted, and original solution.
         See also the FieldWithinTolTC's
         :attr:`~credo.systest.fieldWithinTolTC.FieldWithinTolTC.defFieldTol`.
       * fieldTols: a dictionary of tolerances to use when testing particular
         fields, rather than the default tolerance defined by 
         the defFieldTol argument.
