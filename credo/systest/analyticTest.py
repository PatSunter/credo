       This case requires the user to have configured the XML correctly
       to load an anlytic soln, and compare it to the correct fields.
       Will check that each field flagged to be analysed is within
       the expected tolerance. Uses a
       :class:`~credo.systest.fieldWithinTolTC.FieldWithinTolTC`
       test component to perform the check.
       
       Optional constructor keywords:

       * defFieldTol: The default tolerance to be applied when comparing fields of
         interest to the analytic solution.
         See also the FieldWithinTolTC's
         :attr:`~credo.systest.fieldWithinTolTC.FieldWithinTolTC.defFieldTol`.
       * fieldTols: a dictionary of tolerances to use when testing particular
         fields, rather than the default tolerance defined by 
         the defFieldTol argument.
