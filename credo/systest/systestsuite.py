    .. attribute:: projectName

       Name of the "Project" the test suite is attached to, e.g. "Underworld"
       or "StgFEM".

    .. attribute:: suiteName

       A short descriptive name of the test suite. NB: doesn't have to be
       unique, e.g. you may want to create different suites with the same\
       suite names, but different project names.
     
    .. attribute:: sysTests

       List of system tests that should be run and reported upon. Generally
       shouldn't be accessed directly, recommend using :meth:`.addStdTest`
       to add to this list, and other methods to run and report on it.
    
    .. attribute:: subSuites

       List of subSuites (defaults to none) associated with this suite.
       Associating sub-suites allows a nested hierarchy of system tests.
    
    .. attribute:: nproc

       The default number of processors to use for tests associated with this
       suite (can be over-ridden per test case though).
