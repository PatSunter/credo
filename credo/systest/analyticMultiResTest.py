       This test can be used to convert any existing system test that
       analyses fields, to check that the error between the analytic
       solution fields and the actual results improves at the required
       rate as the model resolution is increased. Uses a
       :class:`~credo.systest.fieldCvgWithScaleTC.FieldCvgWithScaleTC`
       test component to perform the check.

       Optional constructor keywords:

       * resSet: a list of resolutions to use for the test, as tuples.
         E.g. to specify testing at 10x10 res then 20x20, resSet would
         be [(10,10), (20,20)]
