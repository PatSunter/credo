Welcome to UWA (UnderWorld Analysis)'s documentation!
=====================================================

This documentation describes the UWA (UnderWorld Analysis) toolkit. It comprises
several sections, outlined below, for different purposes.

**For users of UWA:** we suggest you start by reading the :ref:`uwa-intro`
section, then the :ref:`uwa-install` section to get up and running, followed by
running through several of the :ref:`uwa-examples`. The examples should be
self-explanatory, but if you're not familiar with the Python programming and
scripting language, you might like to check out the :ref:`uwa-pythonlinks` section.

**For developers of UWA:**, you'll likely want to jump straight to the
:ref:`uwa-apidocs`, informed by the overall description in
:ref:`uwa-architecture`.
