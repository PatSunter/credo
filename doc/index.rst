Welcome to CREDO's documentation!
========================================

This documentation describes the CREDO scientific benchmarking, testing,
profiling and analysis toolkit. It comprises
several sections, outlined below, for different purposes.

**For users of CREDO:** we suggest you start by reading the :ref:`credo-intro`
section, then the :ref:`credo-install` section to get up and running,
followed by running through several of the :ref:`credo-examples`.
The examples should be self-explanatory, but if you're not familiar
with the Python programming and scripting language, you might like
to check out the :ref:`credo-pythonlinks` section.

CREDO is currently being used as the Testing and workflow support tool of the 
`Underworld <http://www.underworldproject.org>`_ Geodynamics modelling project:-
the manual of which is `available online <http://www.underworldproject.org/documentation.html>`_.

**For developers of CREDO:**, you'll likely want to jump straight to the
:ref:`credo-apidocs`, informed by the overall description in
:ref:`credo-architecture`.
