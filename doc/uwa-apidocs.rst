***********************************
UWA Python Source API Documentation
***********************************

These are the API (Application Programming Interface) documents for UWA,
describing the Python classes and functions provided by the library and how they
function. They are automatically generated from documentation strings
"docstrings" in the UWA Python source code - so in an interactive Python session
you can access this same information using the 
`help() <http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#help>`_
function on objects in your session.

**For users**: you may wish to start with the :ref:`uwa-examples` section, and
then refer back to this API as you become more familiar with UWA and need to
look up details.

**For developers:** the :ref:`uwa-architecture` section gives an initial
overview of how the various sub-packages in UWA relate and are integrated.

.. Note::
   As well as navigating via the contents below, you can also
   use the name-sorted
   :ref:`genindex` of all functions and members, or the module-sorted
   :ref:`modindex`.

*API Documentation contents:*

.. TODO: Need to add command-line programs (eg uwa-restartTest.py) to this
   API reference.
