CREDO
=====

CREDO is a toolkit for running, analysing and benchmarking computational models.

CREDO was originally developed to support better benchmarking and profiling
of the Underworld Geophysics modelling application, based on the StGermain
framework. For more on Underworld (and StGermain), see
http://www.underworldcode.org.

For more details about the design of CREDO and how to run it, see the
documentation in the doc sub-directory.

Basic Installation instructions
-------------------------------

(For more detailed installation instructions, see the "Installation & setup
quickstart instructions" section of the CREDO documentation.)

To run CREDO scripts directly from the command line, you need to set up several
environment variables. These are:

* STG_BASEDIR: the path where your StGermain-based app has been checked out
  and installed to.
* PYTHONPATH: You'll need to update your Python Path to include a reference
  to the directory you installed CREDO into.

In the application bundle CREDO was distributed as part of, there should be
a script you can edit to easily update these variables and then source, such
as "updatePathsCREDO.sh".

After that, you should be good to go!

If you wish to build a local copy of the CREDO documentation, you will need
to first install the 'Sphinx' documentation tool, and the 'Graphviz' plotting
library (for more on these see the doc appendix). Then:
1. cd doc
2. make html
3. make latex; pushd _build/latex; make all-pdf; popd

The documentation will then have been built in the `_build` subdirectory
of `doc`.
