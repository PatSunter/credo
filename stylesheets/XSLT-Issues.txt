Issues:

- Custom XSLT stylesheets for each System test and TestComponent type?
  - Do we save XSLT files for each of these, then template them together?
  - How do we apply the correct stylesheet based on the SysTest type?
    (And is there "inheritance" of styles?)

- How do we refer to these stylesheets from different locations?

- Do we want a stylesheet for providing a basic summary, and one for more
  details? (and perhaps only the details one is generated on the fly?)
