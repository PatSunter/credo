Proposed examples:

Model analysis:
Be able to run a model, and save results
Be able to load an existing ModelRun XML, and then re-do the run.
Be able to document a ModelRun based on existing output directory?
Based on above loading of existing model capability:
Be able to load a ModelResult XML, and then do the following analysis:
plot basic parameters from a group of runs (eg access stuff from FrequentOutput)
analyse field comparison operators from an existing run
